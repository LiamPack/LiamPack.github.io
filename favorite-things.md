# Some All-Time Favorites

Just some of my [Favorite
Things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFNy9iWrpE). This is a very
difficult list to procure due to the "*All-Time*" restriction. I don't
believe this list *can* be, in any way, static, since I continue to
change and evolve. Still a good exercise, since I often forget the
things I like!

Nothing in any particular order.

Probably not exhaustive.

*Very* not finished.
