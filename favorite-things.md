# Some All-Time Favorites

Just some of my [Favorite
Things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFNy9iWrpE). This is a very
difficult list to procure due to the "*All-Time*" restriction. I don't
believe this list *can* be, in any way, static. Still, its a good
exercise to keep track of the things I appreciate.

Nothing in any particular order.

Probably not exhaustive.

By definition, perpetually outdated.

## Textbooks and Resources 
Books marked with a "*" I have not read in full, but felt the impact
they had on my understanding and growth is significant enough to include
them.

*2023-04-07 update:* This list used to be longer. After reflecting,
I'm being more selective due to "rose-tinted glasses" on the texts --
more often than not, I liked the class and the people, not necessarily
the textbook.
