## Notes
Some notes I've written on various topics.

+ Scale Decompositions for Euclidean Quantum Field Theory
  [(notes)](assets/scale-decompositions.pdf).
+ De Giorgi and Moser's approaches to Local Boundedness
  [(notes)](assets/degiorgi-moser.pdf).
+ A Geometric Interpretation of Kalman Filtering
  [(presentation)](assets/ads-kf-presentation.pdf).

## not math
I like making coffee, collecting used books, and rock climbing. I also
like donating previously collected used books after I realize I'll
never read them. I've been playing the flute since 2004, which was a
while ago. In undergrad and post-grad I played a disgusting amount of
[Super Smash Brothers Melee for the Nintendo
Gamecube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YXd48W9pjQ) and ended up
power-ranked in Philadelphia at some point. My favorite languages to
program in are lisps and schemes; I wrote a [monadic
parser](https://github.com/LiamPack/parmesan) after being fed-up with
the state of monadic parsers in OCaml, and a [matrix utilities
library](https://github.com/LiamPack/chez-matrices) after being fed-up
with the state of matrix utilities in OCaml. In order to sway the
tides of a political power struggle, I ended up co-running the
Japanese culture group Kizuna at Swarthmore for a couple of years
which was very fun (despite being very white...).
