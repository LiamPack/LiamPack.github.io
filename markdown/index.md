I'm a PhD student in Cornell's [Center for Applied
Mathematics](https://www.cam.cornell.edu/cam) advised by [Phil
Sosoe](https://math.cornell.edu/philippe-sosoe). I'm interested in
probability and it's connections to analysis and physics. I spend most
of my time staring at measures of the form $d\mu = e^{-V(\phi)}d\phi$.


Prior to my PhD, I worked at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab
from 2020-2023. I worked in autonomous navigation, uncertainty
estimation for neural networks, and atmospheric science. My work was largely under
the [CDAO](https://www.ai.mil/) or
[NASA](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/mars-reconnaissance-orbiter/).

Before that, I completed my undergraduate studies at [Swarthmore
College](https://www.swarthmore.edu/) in Math and Physics in 2020.
