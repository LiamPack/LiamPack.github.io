:::


I'm a PhD student in Cornell's [Center for Applied
Mathematics](https://www.cam.cornell.edu/cam) working under the
guidance of [Phil Sosoe](https://math.cornell.edu/philippe-sosoe). I'm
interested in probability and its connections to analysis and
physics. I spend most of my time staring at measures of the form $d\mu
= e^{-V(\phi)}d\phi$.


Prior to Cornell, I worked at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab
from 2020-2023. I worked in autonomous navigation, uncertainty
estimation for neural networks, and atmospheric science. My work was funded primarily by
the [CDAO](https://www.ai.mil/) and
[NASA](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/mars-reconnaissance-orbiter/).

Before that, I completed my undergraduate studies with high honors in
math and physics at Swarthmore College.
