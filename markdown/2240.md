The second course in the honors first-year sequence at
Cornell. Supposedly designed after Harvard's 55 sequence by [John
Hubbard](https://math.cornell.edu/john-h-hubbard). The students were
incredibly talented. The environment was collaborative, and I felt we
were learning the material together and from each-other.

Course textbook: [Vector Calculus, Linear Algebra, and Differential
Forms: A Unified
Approach](https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Calculus-Linear-Algebra-Differential-dp-0971576688/dp/0971576688).

+ [Problem Sheet](assets/teaching/2240/problem-sheet.pdf) (Second half of semester)

For the second half of the semester, we discussed problems from the
above problem sheet. Some recitations were used to learn new but
relevant material (dual spaces and tensors from a pure vector-space
point of view, Lagrange multipliers through an exactness condition
on morphisms between tangent spaces ...).
