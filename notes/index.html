The purpose of this page is primarily for self-accountability, since <em>writing is thinking</em>. Often times I read a textbook just for fun, but more often I&#39;m trying to learn something. Learning is best done through doing, and passive reading isn&#39;t really &quot;doing&quot;.</p> <p>If you&#39;ve found this somehow and are using these notes as an aid, please <strong>do not</strong> look at any of my &#40;potentially incorrect&#41; problem solutions until you have made a strong attempt at solving the problem yourself&#33; You&#39;ll only learn and digest the material if you put in the time to think deeply and carefully about why the material is built the way it is.</p> <p>If any of my notes or thoughts are inaccurate, please let me know&#33;</p> <p>Recent notes &#40;date indicates last updated time&#41;: <ul><li> 2022-11-22 <a href="/notes/artin/">Algebra; Artin</a> <li> 2022-11-22 <a href="/notes/coursework/">Coursework</a> <li> 2022-11-13 <a href="/notes/stein-shakarchi-b3/">Stein & Shakarchi Book 3: Measure Theory, Integration, & Hilbert Spaces</a> </ul></p> <div class=franklin-toc ><ol><li><a href="#on_the_choice_of_problems">On the choice of problems</a><li><a href="#past_coursework">Past Coursework</a><li><a href="#math">Math</a><ol><li><a href="#a_hrefnotesartinalgebra_artin"><a href="/notes/artin/">Algebra; Artin</a></a><li><a href="#a_hrefnotesstein-shakarchi-b3stein_shakarchi_book_3_measure_theory_integration_hilbert_spaces"><a href="/notes/stein-shakarchi-b3/">Stein &amp; Shakarchi Book 3: Measure Theory, Integration, &amp; Hilbert Spaces</a></a></ol></ol></div> <h2 id=on_the_choice_of_problems ><a href="#on_the_choice_of_problems" class=header-anchor >On the choice of problems</a></h2> <p>Doing problems and work &quot;on the ground,&quot; &quot;getting your hands dirty&quot; is absolutely fundamental to the learning process, especially with difficult and abstract definitions and concepts. Problems involving both calculation and deep thought about a definition are important.</p> <p>Yet I&#39;ll strongly lean towards writing up problems that force deep thought about a definition, counter-example, or theorem. I like these types of problems since they usually have a significance beyond the problem statement itself â€“ often times your intuition is broken due to a counter-example, which teaches you more about what you&#39;re <em>really</em> looking at &#40;not what you <em>think</em> you&#39;re looking at&#41;.</p> <p>Again, this isn&#39;t to discount or discredit problems of a computational type: they&#39;re incredibly important. They just take longer to write up in Latex.</p> <h2 id=past_coursework ><a href="#past_coursework" class=header-anchor >Past Coursework</a></h2> <p><a href="/notes/coursework/">I&#39;ve studied a bunch of things in the past</a>. I haven&#39;t kept the best notes, and, at the time of studying, I didn&#39;t always have a good system to account for knowledge retention &#40;anki, spaced problems, etc.&#41;. Sometimes, I even crammed. Tough times.</p> <p>I hope to go back through some of the texts I studied from and add some notes with commentary on interesting problems or topics. Someday.</p> <h2 id=math ><a href="#math" class=header-anchor >Math</a></h2> <h3 id=a_hrefnotesartinalgebra_artin ><a href="#a_hrefnotesartinalgebra_artin" class=header-anchor ><a href="/notes/artin/">Algebra; Artin</a></a></h3> <h3 id=a_hrefnotesstein-shakarchi-b3stein_shakarchi_book_3_measure_theory_integration_hilbert_spaces ><a href="#a_hrefnotesstein-shakarchi-b3stein_shakarchi_book_3_measure_theory_integration_hilbert_spaces" class=header-anchor ><a href="/notes/stein-shakarchi-b3/">Stein &amp; Shakarchi Book 3: Measure Theory, Integration, &amp; Hilbert Spaces</a></a></h3> <div class=page-foot > <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC BY-SA 4.0</a> Liam Packer.
