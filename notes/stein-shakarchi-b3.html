<p>
For the honors exam I took back in my senior year of college, we were
supposed to have learned up to the end of chapter 2 of this book. Yet
no questions were asked on Lebesgue theory! So I'm going to try to
plow through a little more of this book. My main question-marks
walking into this are:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Where does the notion of measure come into play with respect to differentiation?</li>
<li>Will the fundamental theorem of calculus still hold in this more
abstract setting?</li>
<li>How will the Lebesuge measure guide us to formulating a more
abstract notion of "volume"? (thinking towards these abstract
measure spaces)</li>
<li>What's a fractal lmao.</li>
</ol>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org4adba71">
<p>
Consider the unit interval \([0,1]\) and let \(0 < \xi < 1\). (\(\xi =
    \frac{1}{3}\) will give the cantor set).
</p>

<p>
In stage 1 of the construction, remove the centrally situated open
interval in \([0,1]\) of length \(\xi\). In stage 2, remove <i>two</i>
central intervals each of relative length \(\xi\), one in each of the
remaining intervals after stage 1, and so on.
</p>

<p>
Let  \(\mathcal{C}_{\xi}\) denote teh set which remains after applying
the above indefinitely.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>1. Prove that the complement of \(C_{\xi}\) is the union of open
intervals of total length equal to 1.</li>
<li>2. Show directly that \(m_{*}(C_{\xi}) = 0\).</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org8eeea7c">
<p>
First, \(C_{\xi}\) is closed since it is the (arbitrary)
intersection of closed sets: \(C_{\xi} = \cap_{0}^{\infty}C_{k}\), where \(C_{k}\)
denotes the remaining points of \([0,1]\) after the \(k^{th}\)
iteration of our algorithm. To see that each \(C_{k}\) is closed:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>\(C_{0}\) is closed (\([0,1]\)).</li>
<li>Let \(C_{k-1}\) be closed with remaining length \((1 -
       \xi)^{k-1}\). First, \(C_{k} = C_{k-1} - \mathcal{O}\), where \(\mathcal{O}\)
is the set of \(k-1\) central open intervals of \(C_{k-1}\) of
relative length \(\xi\). Then \(C_{k}\) is closed as \(C_{k}^{c} = C_{k-1}^{c} \cup
       \mathcal{O}\) is open. Unforunately induction saves the day.</li>
</ul>


<p>
Now for the length issue. This seems like a grind to get the
interval lengths adding up to the form of \((1-\xi)^{k}\). This seems
reasonable right? On the first iteration, we have \(1-\xi\)
length. In the next, we have \((1-\xi) - \xi\cdot(1 - \xi) = 1 - 2\xi + \xi^{2} =
     (1-\xi)^{2}\). On the \((k+1)^{th}\) iteration we have \((1-\xi)^{k} - \xi\cdot(1 -
     \xi)^{k}\). Doesn't that seem like \((1 - \xi)^{k+1}\)? Right? We'll say it
does.
</p>

<p>
Then as \(k \to \infty\), \((1 - \xi)^{k} \to 0\) if \(\xi < 1\). Therefore \(_{}C_{\xi}^{c}
     \rightarrow 1\) as desired. We obtain this by applying Theorem 3.2
(\(m_{*}(C_{\xi}) + m_{*}(C_{\xi}^{c}) = 1\)), which is allowed since open and
closed sets are measurable.

<h5 id="org3f7c2d2">2.</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org3f7c2d2">
<p>
First note, as before that \(C_{\xi} = \cap_{k=0}^{\infty}C_{k}\), where we
have that \(C_{k} \subset C_{k-1}\) for all \(k\). Then by monotonicity,
\(m_{*}(C_{\xi}) \leq m_{*}(C_{k})\) for all \(k\). But we know from the
previous problem that \(m_{*}(C_{k}) = (1 - \xi)^{k}\) since \(C_{k}\)
is exactly the union of disjoint closed cubes, and therefore
\(m_{*}(C_{k}) = \sum_{i=0}^{2^{k}}Q_{i} = (1-\xi)^{k}\). Then
\(m_{*}(C_{\xi}) \leq (1-\xi)^{k}\) for all \(k\), and therefore \(m_{*}(C_{\xi}) =
     0\).
