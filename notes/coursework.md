# **Swarthmore College (Honors Math & Physics B.A.)**
## **Honors Exams**
The honors exams were a culminating set of examinations to test deep
understanding of graduate-level course topics. These exams are meant to
simulate graduate-level qualification examinations. Material from **Math
104, 101, 102** and **Physics 112** were tested, for each course, in a
three-hour exam and one-hour oral with examiners from schools across the
country.

## **Math 104** *Point-Set & Algebraic Topology*
First-year graduate level course in point-set and algebraic
topology. Topological spaces, connectedness and compactness,
countability, Tychonoff's Theorem, Ascoli's Theorem, Baire spaces.
