# Things that I'll get around to reading


## textbooks
### math
- Do Carmo's *Riemannian Geometry*

### applied math
- Luenberger's *Optimization by Vector Space Methods*

### physics
- Geraint & Rosser's *Interpretation of Classical Mechanics*
- Landau & Lifshitz's legendary series, particularly books 1
  (mechanics), 2 (fields), 6 (fluids).
- Baez's *Series on Knots and Everything*
- Reed & Simon's *Methods of Modern mathematical Physics*
- Jose Saletan's *Classical Dynamics; A Contemporary Approach*
- Rief's *Fundamentals of Statistical and Thermal Physics*
  - I have quite a few opinions on introductory statmech books, and I
    need to get through all of the classics to finish the thoughts.
