Recently as I was doing some reading<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> on applying information theory to
detect phase transitions in non-equilibrium systems. What does non-equilibrium
mean? Well it's a long story, but the "essence" of equilibrium is that that
energy only fluctuates locally. And I'm going to leave it at that. What does
information theory mean? That's a big question<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup> so I'll act like you
never said that.
</p>

<p>
So what's the deal with information in non-equilibrium systems? In equilibrium
systems we have all the validity in the world to say there exists a free
energy and phase transitions happen at critical points in the derivatives of
the free energy. But we don't have that for, say, an athermal system! So the
hypothesis is that there are other information measures that can be used other
than (statmech-sense) entropy \(S=k_B \ln W\). Mr. Levine and company used a more
information-theoretic approach and still found amazing results!
</p>

<p>
As a fun way to learn a little bit of javascript, I spent some time looking at
Schroeder's web-based physics simulations you can find <a href="https://physics.weber.edu/schroeder/software/">here</a>. As you might have
guessed already (dang you're on a roll), I looked at <a href="https://physics.weber.edu/schroeder/software/demos/IsingModel.html">his ising model
simulation</a>. It's straightforward to implement this myself (read on!) but
sometimes you just gotta mess around a bit.
</p>

<h3 id="org1fa4216"><span class="todo "></span> Information</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org1fa4216">
<p>
I guess we'll talk a little about information content first. If you've taken
a course in thermodynamics or statistical mechanics, you've probably
(hopefully (please)) seen some mathematical definition of entropy. It comes
in a bunch of different looking equivalent forms, but the one I'll give to
you here is
</p>

<p>
\[ S(X) = -k_{B} \sum_{i} p_{i} \ln\, p_{i} \]
</p>

<p>
where \(p_i\) is the probability of finding the system in state a \(i\). If you're
in thermal equilibrium, \(p_i\) follows a boltzmann distribution in energies
\(E_i\) with a "free" parameter \(T\). The advantage of using this form will be
soon-evident.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, dang isn't that a good-looking equation. There's a lot of content in
why each part of the expression is chosen. Sometimes the entropy is explained
to be how "disordered" a system is, which I don't quite like (e.g it's not
clear water-oil phase separation is the result of "disorder"). This equation
says something more specific. If we choose a different base for the logarithm
(say, base \(2\)), then the sum is actually long-hand for \(E[-\log\,p_{i}]\), the
expectation value of the negative log-probability. This gives us something to
work with conceptually. Since \(0 \leq p_{i} \leq 1\), in log base 2, this is giving
us the expected number of <span class="underline">bits</span> that we would need to encode the frequencies
of states for our system. So it's giving us a sort of "best guess" on the
amount of information needed to completely describe our system in all of its
probabilistic glory. Or something like that, I'm new to this representation
of \(S\) too.
</p>

<p>
The Shannon entropy might look familiar:
</p>

<p>
\[H(X_i) = \sum_{i} p_{i} \log\, p_{i}\]
</p>

<p>
where \(p_i\) is the probability of being in a state \(x_i\) available to \(X\). As
the stereotypical example, let's say \(X\) is the number of heads you can get
on a single coin flip: then \(X\) can take on the values \(x_0 = 0\) and \(x_1 = 1\)
with equal probability. The same analysis above holds here, we're just not
caring about units (more or less) or the second law of thermodynamics anymore
(scary, I know).

<div id="outline-container-orgabf9bcb" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgabf9bcb"><span class="todo "></span> statmech game of life (better known as the ising model)</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgabf9bcb">
<p>
Now what exactly is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ising_model">ising model</a>? If you took CS31 at Swarthmore College<sup>tm</sup>
you'll note that some of the finite-sized simulations look a bit like a game
of life model, but more chaotic depending on the temperature. Just like in
GoL, there are two possible states that a cell could be in. In the case of
the ising model, the possible states can be encoded as \(\mathcal{A} = \{-1,
   1\}\). A state of size \(N\) chosen from this alphabet we'll denote
\(\mathcal{S}_{N} \equiv \{s^{1}, \cdots, s^{N}\}\) where \(s^i \in \mathcal{A}\). These states represent "spin up"
and "spin down", which physically corresponds to the magnetic dipole moments
of the atomic spin of some atom. As for the dynamics, we get most of the
picture just by looking at the Hamiltonian for a given state:
</p>

<p>
\[H(\mathcal{S}_N) = -J\sum_{i, N(i)} s^i s^{N(i)} - \mu \sum_i B s^i. \]
</p>

<p>
Here I denoted the neighbors of cell \(i\) as \(N(i)\). Couldn't think of any
better notation, so we'll deal with it. Breaking this down, we can see that
the first term represents the interaction between two cells that are
neighbors and the second term represents the bias given by a uniform magnetic
field imposed on the system. This bias will skew the magnetics towards a
certain spin direction. The bias is akin to giving an intercept to a straight
line: the character of the line is the same but, instead of having it run
through the origin, it runs through a different intercept value.
</p>

<p>
We have all the power, so we're going to drop the second term since we don't
care about a bias towards one spin or another. Or at least I'm not, maybe you
are. Feel free to voice your concerns. Okay okay but what aobut dynamics?
Well hold your horses. Since we're in thermal equilibrium, the probability of
a specific configuration being chosen is given by the classic Boltzmann
distribution:
</p>

<p>
\[ P_{T}(\mathcal{S}) = \frac{e^{\frac{-H(\mathcal{S})}{k_B T}}}{Z_{T}} \]
</p>

<p>
(Looking at this now, people who know a bit of machine learning might notice
this is a softmax function (\(Z_T\) is a normalizing constant given by the
partition function). Not sure the significance of this since I'm not fluent
in ML right now. Otherwise, i'm calling it neat that math/cs stole from
nature.)
</p>

<p>
Let's check some asymptotics first: If every cell is the same spin, then the
energy simply \(-J\sum_{i,N(i)}1\). If we apply periodic boundary conditions and
allow every cell to have four neighbors, then we get something like \(H =
   -4NJ\). This is a probability-maximum according to \(P_T\), so this is a pretty
likely state, all things considered. Then in the extreme where every neighbor
of a cell is the <i>opposing</i> magnetization, \(H = 4NJ\) and its corresponding
probability is at a minimum. So by continuity or something, the system will
favor confiugrations that are at least locally uniformly magnetized.
</p>

<p>
But as we vary \(T\), we would expect the system to be more
disordered as the probability distribution slowly smooths out. The
temperature acts as a balancing agent to the energy. Or something
like that.
</p>

<p>
So how would we simulate something like this? Well, being the statistical
mechanicians we are we're well prepared for this: for the not final time,
we're in thermal equilibrium! This means that energy transfer is short-ranged
and localized. Then, given a system state \(\mathcal{S}\), we're justified in
flipping <i>only one</i> atom from one magnetic state (quasi-static transition
between states, reversible, words that mean something to some people). How do
we choose this atom? We put on our computer scientist hat and say "well,
nothing Monte Carlo simulations can't solve," which is an annoyingly fancy
way of saying randomly choose from a probability distribution. So we say,
given our state \(\mathcal{S}\), flipping atom \(i\) results in the new state
\(\mathcal{S_i}'\). We choose a new state \(\mathcal{S_i}'\) with probability given
by \(P_{T}(S_i')\). Not bad on paper!

Okay with that over, we can talk about Schroeder's simulation. If you do a
little bit of snooping in the source, you'll find the javascript <code>src</code> block
that implements this simulation procedure. It's pretty fast, considering its
js! As you may have read from the preface of the simulation, he made this as
a proof-of-concept, the concept being that javascript driven web-simulations
can be fast enough to be useful as a pedagogical tool (compared to
downloading some old <code>jar</code> file from PhET).
</p>

<p>
But we're going to one-up PhET and instead of downloading the
simulation, we'll just download every frame of the simulation. Take
that!
</p>

<p>
First we need to take snap-shots of the images that the <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code>
element is displaying on the web page. To do this, we can use the
function <code>toDataURL</code> given by the <code>canvas</code> element and have that hold
the image data. Then, we create a new hyperlink element <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> and
"click" on it. Wrap it up in a function and we have our guy. This will
prompt many, many (many) download requests, so don't forget to mark
"Remember this option" or whatever your computer calls it.

Now all we have to do is plot the data that we grabbed from system
statistics. To do this, we feed the above table into the amazing
<code>gnuplot</code> and make a simple graph of points in a region of interest
(\(T∈[0,5]\)).
</p>

<p>
Maybe a second to talk about what we're going to expect here. At
low temperatures, file size will be smallest since the system will
stay roughly uniform. As we increase the temperature, there will be
a corresponding increase in the background noise of other
spins. Close to the critical point, we would expect islands and
blobs to start forming. After the critical point, things will
become very noisy and there will be some upper-bound on the
compressed file-size, corresponding to a maximally "random"
configuration. Then qualitatively, we may expect the critical point
to be the inflection point of information content. Who knows.

<p>
So that's cool, we can probe the critical points of some order parameter (in
this case, an approximation of information entropy). It turns out<sup>tm</sup> that this
<i>is</i> the critical point of the Ising model where a phase transition occurs. My
advisor for the summer (not for this project (thanks Amy)) told me it had
something to do with fractals and self-similarity, so that sounds hard.

So that's great and all but it could be faster and less hack-y, and I need an excuse
to get back to <code>C</code>.
</p>

<p>
But how will we make nice looking videos and graphics with <code>C</code>? I'm glad you
asked thank you. There are these amazing file formats known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm_format">Netpbm file
formats</a>. A stream of these can be piped to a good video encoder (like <code>x264</code>) to
an mp4 which you can view to your own pleasure. You can find the code <a href="https://github.com/Lucrio/c_ising">on
github</a> (nothing to write home about, short at around ~\(90\) lines).
</p>

<p>
Usage:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash">./ising | x264 --fps 60 -o video.mp4 /dev/stdin
</pre>
</div>

<p>
If you'd like a gif to use (say, at 30fps for 3 seconds), you can also run <code>ffmpeg</code>:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash">ffmpeg -i video.mp4 -r 30 -vf <span style="color: #BA36A5;">scale</span>=512:-1 -ss 00:00:01 -to 00:00:04 video.gif
</pre>
</div>

<p>
So the following is really just an implementation of Schroeder's algorithm in
<code>C</code>.
</p>

</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 2: </span>N=500, 1k sweeps at T=2.2691 (close to critical point)</p>
</div>

<p>
It's bigger faster better stronger. Might do some correlation length
analysis with this code sometime in the future. tune in for more shenaingans I guess.

well first of all its cool and that's all the explanation i need.
</p>

<p>
But other than that, this is more of a proof-of-the-concept that
more complicated systems with more subtle order-disorder phase
transitions could possibly be probed by the information content of
the system. Even for non-equilibrium systems! Amazing! (See <sup><a id="fnr.1.100" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>)
