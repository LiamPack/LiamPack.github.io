Recently (2019) as I was doing some reading<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> on applying
information-theoretic approaches to the detection of phase
transitions in non-equilibrium systems. What does non-equilibrium
mean? In this case, we're talking about <i>thermal</i> equilibrium, since
this is <i>the</i> hypothesis required to apply the usual methods of
thermodynamics to solve for bulk properties of a system (Heat
capacity, internal energy, entropy, &#x2026;). Without this hypothesis,
we can't apply our main statmech tools (maximization of entropy,
microstates equally likely) in deriving relevant quantities.
</p>

<p>
So what's the deal with information in non-equilibrium systems? In equilibrium
systems we have all the agency in the world to apply thermodynamics and probe
phase transitions of the system. But we don't necessarily have these tools
for an athermal system! But this doesn't mean that there isn't information
hiding in the system, in general we can still make counting arguments about
the distribution of states in a system even if thermal equilibrium isn't
there. What we are "counting" is going to be what saves the day, and this is
where some information theory comes into play. We can use a (non
thermodynamic) entropy to probe the system \(S = -\sum p_i \ln p_i\). Mr. Levine and
company used an information-theoretic approach to the ising model and found
some amazing results!
</p>

<p>
As a fun way to learn a little bit of javascript from the 90s, I
spent some time looking at Schroeder's web-based physics simulations
you can find <a href="https://physics.weber.edu/schroeder/software/">here</a>. As you might have guessed already (good guess,
not bad), I looked at <a href="https://physics.weber.edu/schroeder/software/demos/IsingModel.html">his ising model simulation</a>. It's
straightforward to implement this myself (read on!) but sometimes
you just gotta mess around a bit.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org99745a2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org99745a2">Information</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org99745a2">
<p>
We'll talk a little about information content first. If you've taken
a course in thermodynamics or statistical mechanics, you've probably
(hopefully (please)) seen some mathematical definition of entropy. It comes
in a bunch of different looking equivalent forms, but the one I'll give to
you here is
</p>

<p>
\[ S(X) = -k_{B} \sum_{i} p_{i} \ln\, p_{i} \]
</p>

<p>
where \(p_i\) is the probability of finding the system in state a \(i\) and \(k_B\)
is a scaling factor in units of \(Joules/Kelvin\) so make the \(SI\) unit system
consistent. If you're in thermal equilibrium, \(p_i\) follows a boltzmann
distribution in energies \(E_i\), a one-parameter family over \(T\). The advantage
of using this form will be soon-evident.
</p>

<p>
Either way, dang isn't that a good-looking equation. There's a lot of content in
why each part of the expression is chosen. Sometimes the entropy is explained
to be how "disordered" a system is, which I don't quite like (e.g it's not
clear water-oil phase separation is the result of "disorder"). This equation
says something more specific.
</p>

<p>
First of all, this quantity is never negative (saved by the \(-\) sign out
front) since \(0 \leq p_i \leq 1\) for all \(i\), making \(\ln p_i < 0\).
</p>

<p>
If we choose a different base for the logarithm (say, base \(2\)), then the sum
is actually long-hand for \(E[-\log\,p_{i}]\), the expectation value of the
negative log-probability. Lets riff on this.
</p>

<p>
Since \(0 \leq p_{i} \leq 1\), in log base 2, this is giving us the expected number
of <span class="underline">bits</span> that we would need to encode the frequencies of states for our
system. So it's giving us a "best guess" on the amount of information needed
to completely describe our system in all of its probabilistic glory. This
also tells us how much "wasted" space there is in the system
</p>

<p>
The Shannon entropy is going to look familiar. If \(X\) can take on the values
\(\{x_1,x_2, \cdots, x_n\}\):
</p>

<p>
\[H(X) = \sum_{i} p(x_i) \log\, p(x_i)\]
</p>

<p>
where \(p(x_i)\) is the probability of the event \(X=x_i\) occuring. As
the stereotypical example, let's say \(X\) can take on the value
\(heads\) or \(tails\) with equal probability. The same analysis above
holds here, we're just not caring about units (more or less) or the
second law of thermodynamics anymore (scary, I know).
</p>

<p>
Note that you need to know <i>a prior</i> the probability distribution
\(p(\cdot)\) over the set of possible states of the system. In thermal
equilibrium, we can approximate this distribution to incredible
accuracy due to the regularity of the underlying mechanics of such
a system. Without thermal equilibrium, we have no way of knowing,
in general, \(p(\cdot)\) a prior! what a pain! We'll see how encodings
come to the rescue on this issue later.

<div id="outline-container-org5057b69" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org5057b69">statmech game of life (better known as the ising model)</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5057b69">
<p>
Now what exactly is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ising_model">ising model</a>? If you took CS31 at Swarthmore
College<sup>tm</sup> you'll note that some of the finite-sized simulations
look a bit like a game of life model, but are in general more
chaotic-looking depending on the temperature. Just like in GoL,
we're given a discrete grid of dimensions \(N \times M\), where each cell
of the grid \(c[i,j]\) can take on two possible values. In the case
of the ising model, we'll take the state space to be \(\mathcal{A} =
   \{-1, 1\}\). These states represent "spin up" and "spin down"
respectively, which corresponds physically to the magnetic dipole
moments of the atomic spin of an atom (a good model for simulating
the magnetics of some hot metals). We'll denote a microstate of
length \(n\) chosen from this alphabet as \(\mathcal{S}_{n}\equiv \{s^{1},
   \cdots, s^{n}\}\), where \(s^i \in \mathcal{A}\).  As for the dynamics, we get
the whole picture just by looking at the Hamiltonian for a given
state:
</p>

<p>
\[H(\mathcal{S}_N) = -J\sum_{i, N(i)} s^i s^{N(i)} - \mu \sum_i B s^i. \]
</p>

<p>
Here I denoted the neighbors of cell \(i\) as \(N(i)\). Couldn't think of any
better notation, so we'll deal with it.
</p>

<p>
Breaking this down, we can see that the first term represents the
interaction between two cells that are neighbors and the second
term represents the bias given by a uniform magnetic field imposed
by the environment. This bias will skew the net magnetics towards
one of the spin directions (this bias is akin to giving an
intercept to a straight line).
</p>

<p>
So since we have all the power, we're going to drop the second
term! You can keep it if you want. Feel free to voice your
concerns. So, but what about the dynamics? Well hold your
horses. Since we're in thermal equilibrium, the probability of a
specific configuration being chosen is given by the classic
Boltzmann distribution, which factors in the energy of any
particular microstate (\(\mathcal{S}_{n}\) from before):
</p>

<p>
\[ P_{T}(\mathcal{S}_{n}) = \frac{e^{\frac{-H(\mathcal{S}_{n})}{k_B T}}}{Z_{T}} \]
</p>

<p>
Let's check some asymptotics first: If every cell is the same spin, then the
energy simply \(-J\sum_{i,N(i)}1\). If we apply periodic boundary conditions and
allow every cell to have four neighbors, then we get something like \(H =
   -4NJ\). This is a probability-maximum according to \(P_T\), so this is a pretty
likely state, all things considered. Then in the extreme where every neighbor
of a cell is the <i>opposing</i> magnetization, \(H = 4NJ\) and its corresponding
probability is at a minimum. So by continuity or something, the system will
favor confiugrations that are at least locally uniformly magnetized.
</p>

<p>
But as we vary \(T\), we would expect the system to be more
disordered as the probability distribution smooths out due to the
exponential argument tending towards \(0\) (and therefore
\(P_{\infty}(\mathcal{S}_{n}) \rightarrow 1/(\# total\,\,\,
   microstates)\)). Something to keep in mind!
</p>

<p>
So how would we simulate something like this? Well, being the
statistical mechanicians we are we're well prepared for this: for
the not final time, we're in thermal equilibrium! This means that
energy transfer is short-ranged and localized. Then, given a system
state \(\mathcal{S}_{n}\), we're justified in flipping <i>only one</i> atom
from one magnetic state (quasi-static transition between states,
reversible, words that mean something to some people). How do we
choose this atom? We put on our computer scientist hat and say
"well, nothing Monte Carlo simulations can't solve," which is an
annoying way of saying "randomly choose values from a probability
distribution one at a time". So we say, given our state
\(\mathcal{S}_{n}\), flipping atom \(i\) results in the new state
\(\mathcal{S}'_{n}\). We choose a new state \(\mathcal{S}'_{n}\) with
probability given by \(P_{T}(\mathcal{S}'_{n})\). Not so bad on paper!

Okay with that over, we can talk about Schroeder's simulation. If
you do a little bit of snooping in the source, you'll find the
javascript <code>src</code> block that implements this simulation
procedure. It's pretty fast, considering its javascript! As you may
have read from the preface of the simulation, he made this as a
proof-of-concept, the concept being that javascript driven
web-simulations can be fast enough to be useful as a pedagogical
tool (compared to downloading some old <code>jar</code> file from PhET).
</p>

<p>
But we're going to one-up PhET and instead of downloading the
simulation, we'll just download every frame of the simulation. Take
that!
</p>

<p>
First we need to take snap-shots of the images that the <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code>
element is displaying on the web page. To do this, we can use the
function <code>toDataURL</code> given by the <code>canvas</code> element and have that hold
the image data. Then, we create a new hyperlink element <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> and
"click" on it. Wrap it up in a function and we have our guy. This will
prompt many, many (many) download requests, so don't forget to mark
"Remember this option" or whatever your computer calls it.

Now all we have to do is plot the data that we grabbed from system
statistics. To do this, we feed the above table into the amazing
<code>gnuplot</code> and make a simple graph of points in a region of interest
(\(T∈[0,5]\)).
</p>

<p>
Maybe a second to talk about what we're going to expect here. At
low temperatures, file size will be smallest since the system will
stay roughly uniform. As we increase the temperature, there will be
a corresponding increase in the background noise of other
spins. Close to the critical point, we would expect islands and
blobs to start forming. After the critical point, things will
become very noisy and there will be some upper-bound on the
compressed file-size, corresponding to a maximally "random"
configuration. Then qualitatively, we may expect the critical point
to be the inflection point of information content. Who knows.

<p>
So that's cool. We can probe the critical points of some order parameter (in
this case, an approximation of information entropy)! It turns out<sup>tm</sup> that this
<i>is</i> the critical point of the Ising model where a phase transition occurs.

<p>
So that's great and all but it could be faster and less hack-y, and
I need an excuse to get back to <code>C</code>.
</p>

<p>
But how will we make nice looking videos and graphics with <code>C</code>? I'm
glad you asked thank you. There are these amazing file formats known
as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm_format">Netpbm file formats</a>. A stream of these can be piped to a good
video encoder (like <code>x264</code>) to an mp4 which you can view to your own
pleasure. You can find the code <a href="https://github.com/Lucrio/c_ising">on github</a> (nothing to write home
about, short at around ~\(90\) lines).
</p>

<p>
Usage:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash">./ising | x264 --fps 60 -o video.mp4 /dev/stdin
</pre>
</div>

<p>
If you'd like a gif to use (say, at 30fps for 3 seconds), you can also run <code>ffmpeg</code>:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash">ffmpeg -i video.mp4 -r 30 -vf <span style="color: #86e7d7;">scale</span>=512:-1 -ss 00:00:01 -to 00:00:04 video.gif
</pre>
</div>

<p>
So the following is really just an implementation of Schroeder's algorithm in
<code>C</code>. Which is an application of the MCMC Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.
</p>

<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 2: </span>N=500, 1k sweeps at T=2.2691 (close to critical point)</p>
</div>

<p>
It's bigger faster better stronger. Might do some correlation length
analysis with this code sometime in the future. tune in for more shenaingans I guess.

well first of all its cool and that's all the explanation i need.
</p>

<p>
But other than that, this is more of a proof-of-the-concept that
more complicated systems with more subtle order-disorder phase
transitions could possibly be probed by the information content of
the system. Even for non-equilibrium systems! Amazing! (See <sup><a id="fnr.1.100" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>)
