# {{ title }}

A page with notes and thoughts I find and discover in the process of
reading anything and everything. The purpose of this page is primarily
for self-accountability, since *taking notes help understanding*!


If you've found this somehow and are using these notes as an aid,
please **do not** look at any of my (potentially incorrect) problem
solutions until you have made a strong attempt at solving the problem
yourself! You'll only learn and digest the material if you put in the
time to think deeply and carefully about why the material is built the
way it is.

If any of my notes or thoughts are inaccurate, please let me know!

# On the choice of problems
Doing problems and work "on the ground," "getting your hands dirty" is
absolutely fundamental to the learning process, especially with
difficult and abstract definitions and concepts. Problems involving both
calculation and deep thought about a definition are important.

Yet I'll strongly lean towards writing up problems that force deep
thought about a definition, counter-example, or theorem. I like these
types of problems since they usually have a significance beyond the
problem statement itself -- often times your intuition is broken due to
a counter-example, which teaches you more about what you're *really*
looking at (not what you *think* you're looking at).

Again, this isn't to discount or discredit problems of a computational
type: they're incredibly important. They just take longer to write up in
Latex.
