# {{ title }} 

A page with notes and thoughts I find and discover in the process of
reading anything and everything. The purpose of this page is primarily
for self-accountability, since *writing is thinking*. Often times I
read a textbook just for fun, but more often I'm trying to learn
something. Learning is best done through doing, and passive reading
isn't really "doing".

## On the choice of problems
Doing problems and work "on the ground," "getting your hands dirty" is
absolutely fundamental to the learning process, especially with
difficult and abstract definitions and concepts. Problems involving
both calculation and deep thought about a definition are important.

Yet I'll strongly lean towards writing up problems that force deep
thought about a definition, counter-example, or theorem. I like these
types of problems since they usually have a significance beyond the
problem statement itself -- often times your intuition is broken due
to a counter-example, which teaches you more about what
you're *really* looking at (not what you *think* you're looking at).

Again, this isn't to discount or discredit problems of a computational
type: they're incredibly important. They just take longer to write up
in Latex.
