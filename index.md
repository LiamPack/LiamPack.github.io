# {{ title }}

Hey, I'm Liam. Currently I do data science and machine learning, but at
heart I'm most drawn to mathematical descriptions of things (specific, I
know). I studied mathematics and physics, and have a chunk of experience
with computer science.

I'm particularly interested in the mathematical description of
data. In more words:
- implicit regularization in high-dimensional optimization problems
- geometric and topological descriptions of data

Things](/favorite-things/).
