Hey, I'm Liam. Currently I do data science and machine learning, but at
heart I'm drawn to describing things with mathematics (specific, I
know). 

<!-- I'm particularly interested in the mathematical description of -->
<!-- data. In more words: -->
<!-- - implicit regularization in high-dimensional optimization problems -->
<!-- - geometric and topological descriptions of data -->

If you need a wider character profile, check out some of my [Favorite
Things](/favorite-things/). If you want to see what I'm studying these
days, check out my [Notes](/notes/).
