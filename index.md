Hey, I'm Liam. I'm a first-year PhD Student at Cornell's Center for
Applied Mathematics. From 2020-2023, I worked on government contracts
and NASA projects related to uncertainty estimation, atmospheric
modeling, imaging, radar, and other fun stuff. I received my B.A.(s) in
Mathematics and Physics from Swarthmore College in 2020.
