Research Experience

Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory**Jun
2020--Present**Sponsor-driven Research and Development ProjectsLaurel,
MD

**Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer (CRISM) Multispectral VNIR
(MSV) Dataset Connectivity and Calibration**\
PI: Dr. Frank Seelos

$\cdot$=2em -0.5em

Using techniques in spectral graph theory and simplicial homology theory
to determine the connectivity of the graph induced by mars multispectral
strip imagery overlap, where gaps (topological holes) and weaknesses in
the graph are then identified filled in through additional proximity
constraints.

Applying optimization techniques on the MSV dataset to dynamically
balance imagery radiance, informed by aforementioned graphical
techniques, so that coherent and consistent scientific questions can
eventually be asked across the multispectral strip imagery dataset.

Calibrated data to be supplied and published to the CRISM Planetary Data
System (PDS) archive by *June 2023*.

**Completing the CRISM TER/MTRDR PDS Archive Restricted Gimbal Angle
Targeted Observations**\
PI: Dr. Frank Seelos

$\cdot$=2em -0.5em

Empirically modeling the effect of the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging
Spectrometer (CRISM) instrument's gimbal motion on the atmospheric
content of gathered imagery to allow for removal of atmospheric
artefacts, eventually producing clean top-of-atmosphere normalized
imagery. Utilized constrained optimization techniques to obtain
physically reasonable solution sets. Work done in collaboration with
post-doc Dr. Yuki Itoh and Dr. Frank Seelos.

Successfully applied aforementioned techniques to parts of the
restricted gimbal angle targeted observations, allowing them to be in a
deliverable state to the scientific community, previously impossible due
to the absence of sufficient modeling techniques.

Calibrated data products to be supplied and published to the CRISM
Planetary Data System (PDS) archive by *March 2023*.

**Applying Self-Supervised Representation Learning to Mars Hyperspectral
Imagery**\
PI: Liam Packer

$\cdot$=2em -0.5em

A short, one month long research initiative to extend unsupervised
representation learning techniques to hyperspectral and multispectral
imagery, primarily with techniques from the recent paper *Masked
Autoencoders are Scalable Vision Learners* (He et al. 2021).

Discovered that unsupervised training of masked vision transformers on
multispectral data via standard reconstruction objectives has difficulty
with convergence due to lack of a-priori enforcement of continuity
between nearby spectral channels.

Research and software can be used for future exploration of
multispectral data via representation building followed by a
dimensionality reduction technique (e.g. UMAP, t-SNE) to understand
structure, shape, and organization of multispectral data.

**Astrocomb Laser: A Compact, Low SWaP, High-Repetition Rate Frequency
Comb**\
PI: William Ames

$\cdot$=2em -0.5em

Designed, prototyped, and currently building a frequency comb
instrument, which is laser-based hardware used for e.g. precise clock
timing and spectral filtering.

Obtained stable supercontinuum (wide frequency bandwidth) generation
measurements, one of the most difficult components of the system which
requires stable lasing, heat management, and pulse propagation across
multiple pump stages.

**Go Ask Alice: Uncertainty, Explainability, and Out of Distribution
Decisions for Deep Neural Networks**\
PI: Eryk Banatt

$\cdot$=2em -0.5em

Evaluated feasibility of existing literature techniques for black-box
explainability and uncertainty estimation, including Bayesian,
ensemble-based, and latent-space geometric approaches, especially for
out-of-distribution and real-world applications.

Conducted several ablation studies and statistically significant testing
to show that many techniques in the literature of explainability are
insufficient for real-world applications. Empirically showed many
uncertainty estimation techniques fail due to underlying assumptions not
holding in the representations built by deep computer vision models.

Results of the work eventually to be used to understand and evaluate, in
real-time, the nature, stability, and failure modes of
out-of-distribution decision making of deep neural network models.

**Hawkeye: Building Deep Neural Networks to Beat Matched Filtering in
Speed and Space at Negative SNR**

$\cdot$=2em -0.5em

Built Pytorch-based deep learning framework for prototyping deep
learning algorithms for locating and identifying 1-D signals in negative
Signal-to-Noise ratio (SNR) situations.

Developed deep convolutional neural network architectures which perform
faster than traditional matched-filtering based approaches with
comparable performance.

FellowSwarthmore, PA

**Jamming of Granular Materials in a Pin Lattice**\
Advisor: Amy Graves

$\cdot$=2em -0.5em

Compared effects of pin lattice geometries on the elasticity of a
bidispersed system of soft spheroids through extensive simulation,
implemented to output elasticity tensor and relevant bulk statistics.

Assessed validity of simulation through comparison of the theoretical
and simulated elasticity parameters, expected and actual jamming
probability of the system, and analysis of bulk parameters.

**Predicting Cluster Memory Usage for Adaptive Network RAM** \
Advisor: Tia Newhall

$\cdot$=2em -0.5em

Engineered load-balancing heuristics for network RAM shared across a
distributed system. Achieved through a modified linux kernel with an
implemented driver for logic and execution.

Gathered and analyzed statistics from heuristics when applied to the
allocation and distribution of volatile memory across multiple nodes in
our distributed system.
